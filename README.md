MKTG 3000 (Marketing is Everything)

This project was to help a start-up company (Star Learning) market its product in two market segments. These market segments were after school learning centers and instructional small businesses. The challenge was that the company needed to understand the target market and its competitors. For instance, Star Learning needed to understand its customers, context, company, collaborators, and competition to effectively market its product in these markets.

•	Created a marketing plan for a start-up company to market its product, utilizing the Marketing Framework to ensure that the plan is focused and impactful

•	Analyzed target markets, market trends, and constraints, providing a complete picture of current market and competitors

•	Developed a value proposition for Star Learning, which helped the company communicate its product value to customers

•	Performed SWOT analysis and provided a complete picture of the 5Cs (Customers, Context, Company, Collaborators, and Competition) and the 4 Ps (Product, Price, Promotion, and Place) to executives

•	 Developed success metrics for the company’s product, delivering a picture of what success looks like in the end goal
